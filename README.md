📦 Global Supply Chain Risk & Performance Dashboard

End-to-End Data Engineering & Business Intelligence Solution

🚀 Project Overview

👉 In a globalized economy, supply chain visibility is the difference between profit and loss. This project addresses the "Black Box" problem in logistics by creating a centralized data warehouse in Snowflake and an executive-level diagnostic dashboard in Power BI.

👉 By analyzing 180,000+ transaction records from the DataCo Smart Supply Chain dataset, I identified critical failure points in premium shipping tiers and geographical regions where late deliveries were significantly impacting service level agreements (SLAs).

🏢 Business Problem Statement

👉 The organization lacked a "Single Source of Truth" for logistics performance. Management could not identify:
⁕ Which shipping modes were consistently failing to meet promised delivery dates.
⁕ Which global regions represented the highest risk for customer dissatisfaction.
⁕ The correlation between aggressive delivery scheduling and actual delay risk.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Data Architecture

1. Data Warehousing (Snowflake)
⁕ Infrastructure: Deployed an X-SMALL virtual warehouse to optimize cost-to-performance ratio.
⁕ ETL Process: Designed a robust schema (SUPPLY_CHAIN_DB.RAW_DATA) to handle multi-dimensional logistics data.

SQL Proof of Concept:

Resolved data integrity issues during ingestion, specifically handling ISO-8859-1 encoding for international region names.
Data Modeling: Utilized SQL to transform raw transaction logs into an analytical table (DATACO_CLEANED_TABLE) optimized for BI consumption.

2. Business Intelligence (Power BI)

⁕ Connectivity: Established a secure connection to Snowflake using Import Mode to ensure high-speed interactivity for end-users.
⁕ DAX & Analytics: Developed custom measures to calculate Late Delivery Rates and Service Level Compliance.

📊 Dashboard Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I developed an 8-point visualization suite to provide a 360-degree view of operations:
⁕ Risk by Shipping Mode: Uncovered that First Class and Second Class shipments actually carried higher delay risks than Standard Class.
⁕ Global Heat Map: Visualized geographical bottlenecks, pinpointing high-delay zones in Southeast Asia and South America.

⁕ Scheduled vs. Actual Scatter Plot: Proved that orders scheduled for "1-2 Day" delivery had a failure rate 3x higher than those with a 4-day window.
⁕ Customer Segment Donut: Identified that Corporate clients were experiencing the same delay rates as individual consumers, indicating a lack of B2B prioritization.
⁕ Top 10 High-Risk Countries: A focused bar chart highlighting the specific nations where the carrier network is most fragile.

💡 Strategic Business Recommendations

Based on the data, I proposed the following actions:
⁕ Carrier Renegotiation: Investigate the First Class carrier contract, as the premium price paid is not translating to premium performance.
⁕ Lead-Time Padding: Automatically add a 1-day buffer to delivery estimates for the top 5 high-risk countries identified in the dashboard.
⁕ Segment Prioritization: Implement a "Priority Lane" for Corporate Segment orders to protect high-value contracts from supply chain volatility.

🎯 Deployment Instructions
